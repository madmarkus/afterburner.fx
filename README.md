afterburner.fx
==============

The opinionated just-enough-framework (2 classes) MVP for JavaFX

afterburner.fx provides:

1. "Zero-Configuration" javax.inject.Inject DI of models and services
2. Convention-based unification of presenter, view, FXML and css.
3. Afterburner is a "Just-Enough-Framework" extracted from [airhacks-control](https://github.com/AdamBien/airhacks-control) and used in [airpad](https://github.com/AdamBien/airpad) applications

The use of afterburner.fx is demonstrated in [https://github.com/AdamBien/followme.fx](https://github.com/AdamBien/followme.fx)

This fork
---------

This fork is intended to enable afterburner.fx to be used with Java 7.

As this can be done by some changes to the maven pom.xml, the framework is not affected ;-)
